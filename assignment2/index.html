I think this is really good for once again, the younger audience who have short attention spans, and when they click on a music video, tend to not stick around long enough until the good (usually the chorus or bridge) part comes. With this, they can quickly press the button and jump ahead, before judging if they want to stick around for the full video or not. It helps both musician and viewers alike, helping better chance of viewership (since most views count after 30 seconds to fight off bots) as well as easier judgement in music/visuals. -->

You can also have discussions on your interpretations on the music video as well with fellow fans or even the musician themself, and helps create a strong community and fanbase!! My chosen feature is the comment section. Including a comment section provides users with a  familiar interaction model inspired by YouTube, where audiences can engage with the content and each other. This decision was influenced by the context of designing not just a "player," but an interactive platform that emphasizes community and user voice. It also functions as feedback: creators gain insights into how their media is received. In UX terms, this promotes participatory culture (Jenkins, 2006), where audiences move beyond consumption to contribution.  -->

Padding inside ensures text doesn't feel cramped, making the input approachable and human-centered. -->

This provides immediate visual feedback, which is essential in usability and its large size and placement according to the rule of thirds in UX/UI immediately grabs for attention. Nielsenâ€™s usability heuristics (1994) highlight that visibility of system status is critical. Hover effects let the user know their interaction is being registered. -->
