    font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace;     /* I chose 'Courier New', Courier, monospace as the primary typeface for my minimap interface. This font evokes a utilitarian, digital aesthetic that complements the idea of a technical or coded environment, aligning with the concept of a "digital art gallery" or virtual minimap. The virtuality of this is enhanced even more by being able to scroll and seamlessly navigate and click through each image, rather than the traditional sense in where you simply look around. It is interactable and scrollable; a feature that only the digital space can provide, unlike reality. Its fixed-width structure visually references old computer interfaces, aligning with my portfolio’s slightly gaming tone and visual horror narratives, since all my artwork here have been involved in designing for video games and includes usages of lots of dark colour like black and red.  In a gallery context, this monospaced font enhances legibility and neutrality, ensuring that the interface doesn’t compete visually with the artwork itself. It functions as a quiet, reliable system font, much like the unobtrusive labeling systems used in physical galleries or technical displays.  The consistency in spacing also creates a structured rhythm when paired with scrolling and hover interactions, subtly reinforcing the idea of precision and control in digital environments. I wanted to reflect how even simple typographic choices can support usability and reinforce the identity of a minimal, code-like aesthetic, reminiscent of grids, catalogues, or databases that categorize artworks. */
    background-color: #0d0d0d; /* The chosen color palette — primarily black (#0d0d0d), and text being white (#ffffff), and a muted red gradient for the word "Portfolio" (#000000 → #760808) was intentionally selected to complement the context of scrolling within a digital art gallery environment.  The black background establishes a cinematic and immersive setting, similar to how physical galleries often use neutral lighting and dark walls to draw focus toward illuminated artworks. This aligns with my goal of creating a “scrollable exhibition space” where each artwork appears to emerge from darkness as the user navigates.  White text provides strong contrast and ensures readability, maintaining visual clarity across various screen sizes. This contrast also supports accessibility by enhancing legibility for continuous scrolling, an essential usability consideration in an interaction that emphasizes fluid motion and sustained engagement. */

This approach also supports the concept of a curated digital gallery, where the viewer’s navigation is guided smoothly and purposefully, mimicking the feeling of moving through a gallery rather than a web page.

Red was chosen for its association with passion, energy, and creative intensity, but it’s muted enough not to overwhelm. Its gradient effect creates a sense of directional flow, visually reinforcing the motion of scrolling and drawing the eye horizontally, echoing the linear movement users make as they navigate through the minimap. This combination of dark grounding tones and vibrant accent color also references the minimalist design language of professional portfolios and art spaces, where the interface recedes to highlight the content. The color decisions were made not purely for aesthetics, but to strengthen the experiential connection between the user and the act of scrolling itself — making it feel smooth, deliberate, and contemplative, much like walking through an art exhibition.  */
