<!-- Each card -->
<div class="container">
  <div class="card"><div class="card-inner" id="q1"><h2>
    (1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The first thing I noticed when I began interacting with the website was the buzzing fly that acted as the cursor. Its constant motion immediately drew my attention and added a playful, engaging quality to the experience. I was also drawn to the power button positioned in the center of the large icon. The neon color contrasted sharply against the monochromatic colour palette and expanded when I hovered over it, clearly signaling that it was interactive. This combination of motion and visual emphasis made the initial interaction interactive and fun.
    </p></div></div>
  <div class="card"><div class="card-inner" id="q2"><h2>(2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">At first, I spent a few seconds figuring out how to proceed. I clicked the button in the center of the icon, which triggered a dialogue that left me momentarily confused, but then an arrow appeared on the right, prompting me to scroll downward. This led to a carousel of different sections, and I clicked the large “About” text, which introduced a phone interface. I instinctively tried scrolling again, noticing how engaging and interactive the phone design made the content. Next, I clicked the three-line menu in the top right, triggering an animation of a hand pulling down the content list, and then clicked the “X” button to close it. I used the top-left button to return to the home screen and scrolled down to the “Work” section, guided by a downward-pointing arrow. I scrolled down to interact with the laptop, and go through its contents. After reaching the end, I returned home and scrolled to the “Links” section, briefly navigating to another site before returning. Finally, I explored the buttons on the right, including the award and mail buttons, and clicked the “Links” button again, which brought me back to the external site.</p></div></div>
  <div class="card"><div class="card-inner" id="q3"><h2>(3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">I spent the most time engaging with the “About” section of the website, which used a phone interface to present its content. I found this part particularly compelling because it encouraged exploration through scrolling and felt original, a design choice I don't usually see often, making the experience feel interactive and dynamic. The way information was revealed on the phone screen made it feel more interactive and I liked scrolling up and down the phone. I appreciated how the design blended familiar digital interactions with creative presentation. This section stood out as the most engaging because it combined playful interactivity with clear visual cues, keeping me focused, curious and inspired.</p></div></div>
  <div class="card"><div class="card-inner" id="q4"><h2>(4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The most common action during my two-minute interaction was clicking the home button on the top left corner and then having to scroll down from the very start to reach the next section. This repeated action highlighted the site’s navigation structure and also the importance of visual cues, like arrows, to guide users through the content and how so. It also made me more aware of how the design balances interaction and exploration, encouraging users to actively engage with the website instead of just passively consume information. This makes it more interesting, and not boring nor plain despite its simple design.</p></div></div>
  <div class="card"><div class="card-inner" id="q5"><h2>(5) What is the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The primary goal of the interactive experience appears to be to engage users in exploring the content in a playful and memorable way yet still looking like a professionally simple portfolio. The website emphasizes interactivity through dynamic elements such as the buzzing fly cursor, clickable buttons, and a phone-based content display, all the while not being too maximalist and throwing in all kinds of elemets everywhere. It is very simply effective, and straightforward in its communication of a portfolio, clearly conveying how professional the creator is when it comes to choosing, designing elements in UI and how to make them the most effective. It also highlights key information using large icons on the homepage and bright, contrasting colors that stand out against the otherwise plain color palette to bring the viewer to the "Awards" button. This section conveys even more how professional and widely recognized the creator is, showcasing all his achievements neatly in a professional list. These design choices guide users’ attention, encourage exploration, and make navigation intuitive while also conveying the aesthetic and design principles the designer has strongly mastered. Through visual cues, animations, and a clear scroll-based structure, the experience aims to make discovery enjoyable and immersive while emphasizing the professionally effective creative presentation of its content, and that much time as well as thought has been put in.</p></div></div>
  <div class="card"><div class="card-inner" id="q6"><h2>(6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Adding to my answer for Question 5, the website communicates its primary goal through thoughtful interaction design and visual guidance. Elements like the buzzing fly cursor and subtle animations create a sense of movement and encourage users to explore, while the phone-based content display presents information in a familiar, interactive way. Large icons and strategically contrasting colors act as visual signposts, directing attention to key areas such as the “Awards” section. Navigation cues, including arrows and scroll-triggered transitions, make the experience intuitive and reinforce the playful yet professional tone. Altogether, these design choices ensure that users can easily engage with the content while appreciating the creator’s skill and the carefully considered presentation.</p></div></div>
  <div class="card"><div class="card-inner" id="q7"><h2>(7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">My impression is that the experience is primarily designed for short-term engagement, encouraging users to explore deeply during a single session rather than return frequently over time. While the interactive elements—such as the buzzing fly cursor, scroll-triggered animations, and phone-based content display—are playful and immersive, they offer limited incentive for repeated visits since the content remains static. The design effectively guides users through the site with large icons, contrasting colors, and arrows, but it feels more like a curated journey than an evolving platform. One limitation is that once a user has explored all sections, there is little new to discover, which reduces long-term engagement potential. Additionally, while the interactivity is engaging, it can sometimes feel gimmicky, and the emphasis on playful exploration might overshadow some of the more critical content, like the creator’s professional achievements, if users are only skimming for visual flair. Overall, the experience is memorable and enjoyable, but it prioritizes immediate impact over sustained interaction, which may limit its effectiveness for users who would benefit from returning multiple times.</p></div></div>
  <div class="card"><div class="card-inner" id="q8"><h2>(8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time primarily through visual and interactive cues that guide immediate engagement, rather than long-term return. Elements such as the buzzing fly cursor, scroll-triggered animations, and interactive phone-based content demonstrate how users are expected to explore each section through clicking and scrolling and were told this by using arrows. These arrows provide clear signals for navigation, but they only showed up for a brief moment. Large icons, and highlighted buttons also draw our attention since they contrast from the monochromatic colour palette, helping us navigate where to click and go, reinforcing the idea that users should actively engage with content rather than passively view it. Since the website is a portfolio, it contains a limited amount of content, focusing only on the most important elements—such as the “Mail”, "Links", etc buttons, which appear on every section or page. The constant presence of the "Mail" button subtly reinforces the idea that users can contact the creator at any time, highlighting the portfolio’s professional purpose and gently guiding the audience toward hiring him as a designer. While the site effectively communicates how to interact in the moment, its lack of updated content or long-term engagement features makes it clear that the experience is designed for single-session exploration rather than repeated visits, especially since his "Links" button leads the viewer to a whole other site, linktree, which means he probably updates his other links more frequently as well. The website lacks features that encourage repeated visits, such as updated content, progress indicators. While the portfolio includes sections like “Work” that showcase completed projects in addition to awards and contact information, the overall content remains limited and curated, focusing only on the most important elements. While the site effectively communicates how to interact in the moment, it does not provide mechanisms to sustain user interest over time and lack of evolving content or features for repeated visits, limits its long-term interactivity potential.</p></div></div>
  <div class="card"><div class="card-inner" id="q9"><h2>(9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The interactive experience references several other media forms, both digital and physical, in its design. The phone-based content display draws directly from familiar smartphone interfaces, creating a tactile and intuitive interaction similar to using a mobile app. The carousel-style navigation and scroll-triggered transitions remind me the experience of browsing interactive galleries or digital magazines, where content is revealed progressively. Large icons and a selected few of bright, contrasting colors are reminiscent of modern UI trends in websites and apps, especially those following suit of the ongoing trend of minimalism nowadays, while the playful animated cursor brings to mind elements from casual online games or gamified interfaces. Additionally, the clean, structured layout and emphasis on key sections echo the organization of physical portfolios or exhibition displays, where important works are highlighted for easy viewing. Altogether, these references to both digital and physical media help make the website feel familiar yet engaging, blending interactivity with professional presentation.</p></div></div>
  <div class="card"><div class="card-inner" id="q10"><h2>(10) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The references to other media forms communicate clearly how I should interact with the experience. The phone-based interface signals that I should explore content by scrolling, just as I would when using a mobile app, encouraging active engagement rather than passive viewing. Carousel-style navigation and scroll-triggered animations suggest a sequential exploration, guiding me to progress through each section in order and take the time to discover content fully. The use of large icons and contrasting colors highlights important elements, prompting me to focus on key areas like the “Work” and “About” sections, while the constantly visible “Mail” button subtly reminds me that contacting the creator is an intended action. Overall, these media references create a playful yet structured interaction, showing me that I should explore deliberately, engage with each interactive element, and recognize the professional context of the portfolio as I navigate it and the designer's capabilities and intent in bringing out these certain designs.</p></div></div>
  <div class="card"><div class="card-inner" id="q11"><h2>(11) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h2><p>The references to other media forms communicate that I should feel curious, engaged, and playful, while also appreciating the creator’s professional skill. The animated cursor and scroll-triggered transitions evoke interactions found in casual online games and gamified apps, which research suggests can enhance user engagement by encouraging exploration and active participation (Norman, 2013). The phone-based interface draws from familiar smartphone interactions, making users feel comfortable navigating content while subtly framing the portfolio as contemporary and relevant (Tidwell, 2020). Large icons and bright, contrasting colors act as visual signifiers, a technique commonly used in UI design to guide attention and evoke focus (Johnson, 2014). At the same time, the structured layout and minimalist design convey professionalism and competence, balancing the playful elements to create an emotional response that is both enjoyable and reassuring. These cues together encourage me to explore deliberately, linger on key sections like “Work” and “Awards,” and recognize the portfolio as a carefully curated demonstration of the creator’s design expertise.

  <div class="card"><div class="card-inner" id="q12"><h2>(12) What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The most frustrating part of the interaction is the navigation between sections. Every time I click the home button, I am returned to the very start of the carousel and must scroll down repeatedly to reach the last section from where I left off, with no way to jump directly to it easily. This interrupts the flow of exploration and makes navigating the site feel tedious. Another point of frustration is the placement of interactive elements within the carousel. To me, the large icons of each section (for example, "Work") are visually dominant and immediately draw attention since they were way larger than the words, but they are not clickable; instead, the interactive areas are the smaller text elements below them. Since my attention is naturally drawn to the icons first, it feels unintuitive and slightly disorienting that they do not serve as the primary interaction points. Together, these design choices make the experience less smooth and can momentarily confuse or slow down users, or those like-minded as me, who are trying to explore efficiently.</p></div></div>
  <div class="card"><div class="card-inner" id="q13"><h2>(13) What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The most satisfying part of the interaction is exploring the “About” and “Work” sections through the phone-based/laptop-based content display. It feels engaging to scroll through the content as if I were interacting with a real device, and the smooth animations and transitions make the experience feel responsive and immersive. I also really enjoy the animation of the hand pulling down the menu bar, which adds a playful, interactive touch while clearly showing how to navigate. The hand-drawn yet modern aesthetic of the site adds personality and charm, making it feel approachable and creatively unique. Visual cues, such as arrows and highlighted buttons, guide me intuitively from one section to the next, also making me feel a sense of accomplishment as I discover all the content. Additionally, the consistent presence of the “Mail” button throughout the site reinforces the professional purpose of the portfolio, subtly reminding me of the creator’s accessibility. Altogether, these elements make the experience feel playful, interactive, and rewarding, although still professionally simple, and effective in its minimalistic apporach, providing both visual enjoyment and a clear sense of direction.</p></div></div>
